    NOTE: since this was a sample test, i did not copy paste this. but 
    the question remains the same
    desc: iterate through a range [1, n] and for each i, 
        if i multiple of 3 -> print("Fizz")
        if i multiple of 3 -> print("Fizz")
        if both -> print("FizzBuzz")
        else -> print(i)
    constraints: 
        1. 0 < n, arr[i] <= 100
    idea:
        originally, obvious answer came to mind, iterate thru all
        have unique printing variables for all the cases, however,
        the look of the string "FizzBuzz" immediately screamed
        string concatenation.

void fizzBuzz(int n) {
    // your implementation

int main() {
    fizzBuzz(15);  // Example usage
    return 0;
