# Sorting Algorithms: Overview and Explanations

## Overview

Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to arrange elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending). This document provides an overview of popular sorting algorithms, their time and space complexities, and explanations of how they work.

## **Popular Sorting Algorithms**

### **1. Bubble Sort**

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### **Explanation**

- Works by "bubbling up" the largest element to the end of the list in each pass.
- Simple but inefficient for large datasets.

#### **Graphic**

```
Pass 1: [5, 3, 8, 4, 6] → [3, 5, 4, 6, 8]
Pass 2: [3, 5, 4, 6, 8] → [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
Pass 3: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] → [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] (sorted)
```

### **2. Selection Sort**

Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n²)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### **Explanation**

- Simple and intuitive but inefficient for large datasets.
- Performs fewer swaps than Bubble Sort.

#### **Graphic**

```
Pass 1: [5, 3, 8, 4, 6] → [3, 5, 8, 4, 6]
Pass 2: [3, 5, 8, 4, 6] → [3, 4, 8, 5, 6]
Pass 3: [3, 4, 8, 5, 6] → [3, 4, 5, 8, 6]
Pass 4: [3, 4, 5, 8, 6] → [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] (sorted)
```

---

### **3. Insertion Sort**

Insertion Sort builds the sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly inserting the next unsorted element into the correct position in the sorted part.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n)
- Average: O(n²)
- Worst: O(n²)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### **Explanation**

- Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted lists.
- Works well with online data (data arriving one at a time).

#### **Graphic**

```
Pass 1: [5, 3, 8, 4, 6] → [3, 5, 8, 4, 6]
Pass 2: [3, 5, 8, 4, 6] → [3, 5, 8, 4, 6]
Pass 3: [3, 5, 8, 4, 6] → [3, 4, 5, 8, 6]
Pass 4: [3, 4, 5, 8, 6] → [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] (sorted)
```

### **4. Merge Sort**

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the list into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n log n)
- Average: O(n log n)
- Worst: O(n log n)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(n)

#### **Explanation**

- Efficient and stable (preserves the order of equal elements).
- Requires additional space for merging.

#### **Graphic**

```
Split: [5, 3, 8, 4, 6] → [5, 3] and [8, 4, 6]
Sort: [3, 5] and [4, 6, 8]
Merge: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] (sorted)
```

---

### **5. Quick Sort**

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the list into two sublists (elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot). It then recursively sorts the sublists.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n log n)
- Average: O(n log n)
- Worst: O(n²)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(log n)

#### **Explanation**

- Efficient and widely used in practice.
- Performance depends on the choice of the pivot.

#### **Graphic**

```
Pivot: 5
Partition: [3, 4] (≤5) and [8, 6] (>5)
Sort: [3, 4] and [6, 8]
Combine: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] (sorted)
```

### **6. Heap Sort**

Heap Sort builds a binary heap from the list and repeatedly extracts the maximum element (for max-heap) to build the sorted list.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n log n)
- Average: O(n log n)
- Worst: O(n log n)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(1)

#### **Explanation**

- Efficient and in-place (does not require additional space).
- Not stable.

#### **Graphic**

```
Heapify: [5, 3, 8, 4, 6] → [8, 6, 5, 4, 3]
Extract Max: [8] → [6, 5, 4, 3]
Heapify: [6, 5, 4, 3] → [6, 5, 4, 3]
Extract Max: [6] → [5, 4, 3]
Final Sorted List: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
```

### **7. Counting Sort**

Counting Sort counts the occurrences of each element in the list and uses this information to place elements in the correct position.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n + k)
- Average: O(n + k)
- Worst: O(n + k)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(k)

#### **Explanation**

- Efficient for small ranges of integers (k is the range of input).
- Not a comparison-based sort.

#### **Graphic**

```
Input: [1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2]
Count: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
Sorted: [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 7]
```

### **8. Radix Sort**

Radix Sort sorts numbers by processing individual digits, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD).

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(nk)
- Average: O(nk)
- Worst: O(nk)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(n + k)

#### **Explanation**

- Efficient for sorting numbers with a fixed number of digits.
- Not a comparison-based sort.

#### **Graphic**

```
Input: [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
Sort by LSD: [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]
Sort by MSD: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802] (sorted)
```

### **9. Bucket Sort**

Bucket Sort divides the input into buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates the buckets.

#### **Time Complexity**

- Best: O(n + k)
- Average: O(n + k)
- Worst: O(n²)

#### **Space Complexity**: O(n + k)

#### **Explanation**

- Efficient for uniformly distributed data.
- Requires additional space for buckets.

#### **Graphic**

```
Input: [0.42, 0.32, 0.75, 0.12, 0.89]
Buckets: [[0.12], [0.32, 0.42], [0.75], [0.89]]
Sorted: [0.12, 0.32, 0.42, 0.75, 0.89]
```
